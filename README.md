Thanks in advance for contributing to my project :)

## How to run:
(I will provide compiled binaries from release 1)

## How to build:
**I would highly encourage you to understand each and every steps of the build process**
---

### On GNU/Linux:
1. Get(and install) the go compiler from golang.org.(I recommend you to use the compiler from golang.org, not the package manager's one, and I have not tested the gccgo compile, there are thousands of tutorials available in the internet, for doing this)
2. Ensure that you have [these](https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2#requirements) requirements.
3. Get the zip of my project, extract it anywhere in your pc.
4. Go to the directory where you have extracted it, and run `go build -o tanks`.
5. To run the exectutable, run `./tanks`.

### On Windows:
Almost same as of GNU/Linux, excpet, for the last step, you should use `.\tanks`, and for the first step, you have only one option, i.e., to get your compiler from golang.org.

### On macOS:
I don't use it, BTW, you may contribute the steps....
