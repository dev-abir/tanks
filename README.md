# tanks
A simple tanks war game, written in [GO](https://golang.org/).

I got the images from here:
[tank image](https://opengameart.org/content/pixel-tank)
[bullet imge](https://opengameart.org/content/bullet-symbol)

(I forgot from where I got the sound effects, although I remember I used [this](https://opengameart.org) site to get the sound effects)

I used the [pixel](https://github.com/faiface/pixel) game engine here.

Thanks in advance for contributing to my project :)
